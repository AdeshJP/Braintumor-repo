# Braintumor-repo
This research project combined BM3D filter for noise reduction in brain MRI images with a two-layered CNN model for brain tumor detection.
The image dataset that was utilized is labeled and consists of a total of 253 Brain - MRI pictures. The dataset consists of 155 tumorous Brain MRI images and 98 non tumorous Brain MRI images. The dataset was divided into two sets: one for testing, which was comprised of 20 percent of the images, and one for training, which consisted of 80 percent of the images. 
# CNN MODEL
The CNN Model used is 3 layered with Maxpooling, Convo2D, and Dense Layers. Convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from images. By using a set of learnable filters, these layers can detect patterns or features such as edges, textures or shapes at various spatial locations in the input images.	 Convo2D layers with activation function ReLu are used to perform convolutions on the input image.
Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the model and controlling overfitting.
Overall, the combination of convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for spatial reduction helps the model learn hierarchical representations of the input images, capturing both low-level and high-level features relevant for distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor images.
# Results
The MRI images were successfully cleaned of Additive white gaussian noise using the BM3D filter, resulting in clear and noise-free images. The image with noise on the left is subjected to the BM3D Filter, resulting in a denoised image without noticeable additive white Gaussian noise, which is important for correct diagnosis and evaluation. The third image shows the removal of AWGN. In addition, the CNN model with two layers achieves a detection accuracy of 93.2 % when identifying brain tumors with the use of denoised images. Max-pooling has resulted in enhanced performance of the model when compared to the individual base models. The model has been enhanced to better prevent overfitting.
# Analysis
The CNN model with two layers, used on images that have been cleaned of noise, can easily identify brain tumors with an accuracy of 93.2 %. The identical model obtained a 92.4 % accuracy when the test data set was utilized with no BM3D Filter. BM3D retains the intricate details and patterns within the images while eliminating any unwanted noise. This is critical to ensuring that MRI scans are as diagnostic as possible. The denoising process not only improved the clarity of the images but also enhanced the accuracy of depicting the anatomical features when compared with the original images.
